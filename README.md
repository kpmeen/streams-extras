# Streams Extras

A library consisting of some extra helpers for akka-streams. The idea
is that the library will grow in size (and hopefully usefulness) as time
goes by.


# Usage

Add the dependency for `streams-extras` to your `build.sbt`:

```scala
resolvers += Resolver.jcenterRepo

libraryDependencies += "net.scalytica" %% "streams-extras" % "0.1"
```

Or you can clone the repository and build from source.


# Contributing

suggestions to improvements or new features, feel free to create an issue!
